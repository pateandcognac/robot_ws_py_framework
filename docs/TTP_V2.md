# TTP v2 — Text-to-Performance Pipeline

The performance pipeline turns emoji-punctuated text into synchronized
speech + face + arm performances, now with live face generation by a tiny
fine-tuned on-board LLM (see `TINY_FACE_DEPLOYMENT.md`). Three roles:

```
emote.ttp("Hello! 👋 ...")                emote.gesture(text="...", channel="both")
        │ Speak action                        │ /face/emoji_command, /arm/emoji_command
        ▼                                     ▼                    ▼

Replaced (kept on disk for revert): `audio_and_face_playback.py`,
`arm_playback_node.py`.

## Formats

- **Semantic face format** (`animations/face_semantic/`, one JSON object per
  file): `{emoji, name?, ideation?, frames: [{beat, eyes{left/right/both},
  mouth}]}` with sparse carry-forward frames. This is now the *runtime*
  format, the training format, and the tiny model's output format.
  `animations/face/` (legacy compiled) is no longer read at runtime.
- **Semantic arm format** (`animations/arms_semantic/`): same shape,
  `arms{left/right/both: {shoulder_roll, shoulder_pitch, wrist}}`. This is
  now the *runtime* LUT format too (as of the arm model landing) — the
  legacy `animations/arms/` list-of-state-objects format is kept as a
  training/tooling artifact (`annotate_arm_beats.py`, `arm_animation_tool.py`)
  but no longer read by the sequencer at runtime.
  `shoulder_roll`/`shoulder_pitch` is a training-side rename of the
  ROS-level `joint1`/`joint2` names (legibility only, see
  `TINY_ARM_DEPLOYMENT.md`) — `performance_lib/arm_schema.py` accepts
  either spelling on read and always emits `joint1`/`joint2` when compiling
  to the legacy/ArmPose format, since that's the real hardware wire name.
- **Generated faces** (`animations/face_generated/face_gen_<emoji-slug>__<ts>.json`)
  and **generated arms** (`animations/arm_generated/arm_gen_<emoji-slug>__<ts>.json`):
  rolling per-emoji libraries of tiny-model takes, at most `~store_cap` (5)
  per emoji — oldest rolls out, so each library accumulates and refreshes
  over time. Only emoji-keyed takes are saved; plain-text-inspired results
  stay ephemeral. Arm generations longer than
  `arm_gen_client.MAX_ACCEPTED_FRAMES` (7) are additionally never saved —
  see "Rambling cutoff" below. Never mixed into the LUT dirs (those stay
  the training source of truth).
- **Single-frame pose examples** (`animations/arms/single_frame_examples_semantic/`):
  36 lexically-varied rewordings (3 per original curated pose) of the 12
  hand-authored single-frame arm poses used as Gemini few-shot examples —
  a diversity pool for future dataset-generation prompts, not consumed at
  runtime.

Canonical schema code: `src/logos_hardware/scripts/performance_lib/`
(`face_schema.py`, `face_gen_client.py`, `arm_schema.py`,
`arm_gen_client.py`, `luts.py`); `tools/face_animation_schema.py` and
`tools/arm_animation_schema.py` are re-export shims.

## Topics (JSON payloads in std_msgs/String unless noted)

| Topic | Direction | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `/performance/cue_announce` | director → both animators | `{utterance_id, engine, performance{...}, cues:[{cue_id,index,text,emoji}]}` published *before* synthesis |
| `/face/tts_chunk` | director → sequencer | `SpeechData` (typed; + `cue_id`) |
| `/performance/face_track` | face animator → sequencer | `{cue_id, source: lut/saved/generated, status: partial/complete/failed, frames:[...], append?}` |
| `/performance/arm_track` | arm animator → sequencer | same shape, arm frames |
| `/performance/cue_done` | sequencer → both animators | `{cue_id}` (skip late generations) |
| `/face/emoji_command` | anyone → sequencer+face animator | `{emoji?, text?, duration, cue_id?, expect_track?, policy?, temperature?}` — any string works, not just emoji |
| `/arm/emoji_command` | anyone → sequencer+arm animator | same shape as `/face/emoji_command`; a payload with no `cue_id` is the legacy fast path (straight LUT lookup, no animator involvement) |

`/tts/is_speaking` and all typed face topics unchanged. `/arm/command`
(`ArmPose`) unchanged wire format (`side`, `joint1`, `joint2`, `wrist`).

## Policy cascade & knobs

The director chunks utterances at emoji *and* by sentence/long clause
(~80 chars soft, 100 hard; breaks at sentence enders, then clause
punctuation, then whitespace — `performance_lib/chunking.py`), so
emoji-less prose still gets per-sentence face and arm cues.

Each animator resolves its cues through its own ordered cascade; each step
either handles the cue or falls through:

- `lut` — pure-emoji cue with a LUT entry → publish a status="lut" signal
  (sequencer plays its own copy); cues carrying prose fall through
- `saved` — replay a random take from the per-emoji rolling library
- `generate` — run the tiny model (streamed frame-by-frame by default);
  on failure fall back to a LUT pose: the cue's emoji, a recently
  performed emoji, or `~fallback_emoji` (💬 face / 🧍 arms)

Defaults: face TTS cues `generate,saved,lut`, face command cues
`lut,saved,generate`. **Arms use `generate,saved,lut` for both** TTS and
command cues (fresh bespoke motion first; the LUT cold-open covers
lateness either way — speech never blocks on generation). All four are
independently tweakable via ROS params and, per call, via the cue-announce
"performance" dict's `face_policy`/`arm_policy` keys or a command payload's
`policy` key.

**Rambling cutoff (arms only):** generations past
`arm_gen_client.MAX_ACCEPTED_FRAMES` (7) are presumed to be the model
rambling rather than deliberate choreography — the training data tops out
around 6 frames, and 6+ frame generations (usually at higher temperature)
looked like degenerate drift in spot checks. Streaming generation closes
the connection the instant the 7th frame arrives (saves inference time,
not just playback time); blocking generation truncates the result
afterward. Either way the take is marked truncated and `maybe_save()`
skips it — it plays once and is never added to the rolling library.

Animator params (both nodes): `~model`, `~temperature` (0.3), `~seed`
(0=fresh takes), `~tts_policy`, `~command_policy`, `~save_generations`
(true), `~store_cap` (5), `~stream` (true), `~generate_even_if_late`
(false), `~gen_timeout_s` (30 — runaway guard only; streaming means it
never adds latency), `~fallback_emoji`.
Sequencer params: `~track_wait_s` (15, silent expect_track gestures),
`~switch_threshold` (0.6), `~face_lut_dir`, `~arm_lut_dir`.

Logos-facing API (deliberately slim; knobs above stay backend):
`emote.ttp(text, face="lut"/"generate,saved,lut"/...)` and
`emote.gesture(text, duration, channel, policy=)` where `text` is one
string — emoji, prose, or both; the backend extracts the emoji for
LUT lookups and prompts the tiny model(s) with the string as given.
`policy` applies to whichever channel(s) `channel=` activates.

The "sane mode" is `policy="lut"` everywhere (zero compute, original
behavior). The "already cool" mode is `saved` — replaying a model's
greatest hits for free.

## Timing (measured on-robot)

- LUT: instant. Saved: instant.
- Face generation (`smollm2-135m-face-lora-34k:q4_K_M`): first streamed
  frame ~0.8–1.3s, complete 2–6s typical.
- Arm generation (`smollm2-135m-arm-lora-38k:q4_K_M`): first streamed frame
  ~0.7–2.6s, complete ~2–8s typical (5-9 raw frames before any rambling
  cutoff, though the model requests are for 1-6). **Worth noting:** most
  TTS chunks run 0.5–3s, shorter than a typical arm generation — so per-chunk
  arm generation frequently finishes *after* its cue has already ended and
  been marked done, at which point the result is silently dropped (by
  design: speech never blocks). The arms fall back to their LUT cold-open
  (or sit idle) for that cue while the model quietly finishes in the
  background. Not a bug, but worth knowing before assuming every spoken
  chunk gets bespoke arm motion — gestures (`emote.gesture(channel="arms")`)
  with their longer, deliberately-set durations are a better showcase of
  live arm generation than short TTS chunks.
- Sequencer paces streamed frames across the cue and holds the last pose on
  stalls, for both channels independently.

## Testing

- Lib: `/usr/bin/python3 src/test_stuff/test_performance_lib.py [--live]`
- Nodes launch via `logos_hardware.launch` (revert lines in comments).
- Bench checks without TTS: publish `/face/emoji_command` /
  `/performance/cue_announce` + a `SpeechData` chunk by hand — see git log
  of this feature for exact commands.
